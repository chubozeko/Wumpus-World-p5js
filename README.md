# Wumpus World
Wumpus World is a computer game where a player has to explore a cave of interconnected rooms (blocks). Some blocks contain pits, in which if the player enters it, they will fall into the pit and die. There is one block that contains the Wumpus, in which if the player enters it, the Wumpus will kill them. The player has an arrow which it can use to shoot the Wumpus. The goal of the game is to locate the gold hidden in one of the blocks and return to the starting point without getting killed. 

As an Artificial Intelligence project, a knowledge base has to be created for the agent, as well as keeping track of the environment, which gives the agent the ability to reason for decision making, while dealing with possible unsolvable games.

Project for the "Artificial Intelligence (CMPE411)" course during my studies.
